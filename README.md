Simple interface to connect an SGC tuner to a Kenwood transceiver using the 8 pin version of the CH32V003 microcontroller. I'm currently using this with my TS590SG. Source code is in template.zip. Schematic is in the pdf file. I did not make any pcb for this
I used an soic to DIP pcb adapter and mounted everything on a small project board. Any 5V regulator could be used, I did my initial testing with the 78L05, but had a large quantity of AMS1117 on hand. I have read some negative things on the AMS1117, but it
works for me.
